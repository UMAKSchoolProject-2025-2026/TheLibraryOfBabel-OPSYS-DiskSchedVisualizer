# LibraryOfBabel — Project Context (working summary)

Short purpose
- Disk-scheduling visualizer that models a disk as "The Library of Babel".
- The pointer represents a librarian moving between hexagonal rooms (nodes) to service I/O requests.
- Visual layout: a circular ring of hex rooms with labels; pointer moves clockwise or counter-clockwise.

Repository
- Local path: `C:\Users\orias\OneDrive\Desktop\School Projects\LibraryOFBabel`
- Remote: `https://github.com/UMAKSchoolProject-2025-2026/TheLibraryOfBabel-OPSYS-DiskSchedVisualizer`
- Current working branch (IDE): `master`

Important constraints / design notes
- Keep radial scaling behavior stable — user wants visuals to remain pleasing regardless of node count. Avoid changing or removing the existing scaling heuristics unless intentionally improving them.
- The pointer direction (CW/CCW) movement capability is planned but not implemented yet.
- Thematic: pointer = librarian, walkway = corridor, walls and node borders use gold palette.

Key files to inspect (open in IDE)
- `LibraryOFBabel\Visualization\RadialConfig.cs` — central config + autoscaling logic for nodes, walls, pointer.
- `LibraryOFBabel\Visualization\RadialRenderer.cs` — rendering code that consumes `RadialConfig`.
- `LibraryOFBabel\Visualization\RadialLayoutEngine.cs` — layout math for node placement.
- `LibraryOFBabel\Visualization\SKPaintFactory.cs` — paints/brushes used for drawing.
- `LibraryOFBabel\Visualization\DebugOverlayRenderer.cs` — debug visuals & overlays.
- `LibraryOFBabel\Visualization\NodeRenderMode.cs` — node draw modes.
- `LibraryOFBabel\Form1.cs` — app wiring / main window.
- `LibraryOFBabel\ControlPanel\StasticsAndInfo.cs` — UI stats panel.
- `LibraryOFBabel\ControlPanel\ModeControl.cs` — control panel logic.
- `LibraryOFBabel\Simulation\SimulationEngine.cs` — scheduling algorithms and simulation loop.
- `LibraryOFBabel\UI\ControlManager.cs` — UI control coordination.

Current known TODO / issues
- Pointer direction control and movement logic (CW / CCW) needs implementation.
- Scaling: node autoscaling exists in `RadialConfig.Recalculate()` and additional density/radius scaling properties were added — be cautious when modifying.
- Consider unit tests around `RadialConfig` autoscale & radius math to avoid regressions.
- Add a dev note when you change scaling math: include before/after screenshots and the rationale.
